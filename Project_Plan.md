Architectural Decision: **Option A: PySide6 Desktop Application** - Successfully implemented with comprehensive enhancements

Phase 1: Core Engine & Basic YAML Generation (MVP Foundation)
Objective: Establish the foundational YAML generation and validation logic for simple, sequential action and script steps. Create the backend engine that forms the heart of the application.

Knowledge Base Focus (Source of Truth Document):

Sections 1.3 (Overview of Compound Actions) [cite: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]

Section 11.3 (APIthon Constraints - basic awareness) [cite: 97]

Next Steps & Action Items:

Setup Project Environment:

Action: Initialize a Python project.

Decision: Choose a primary Python version (e.g., 3.10+).

Action: Set up version control (e.g., Git).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 1.1: "AI, provide the sequence of shell commands a developer would use to:

Create a project directory named moveworks_yaml_assistant.

Navigate into this directory.

Initialize a Python virtual environment (e.g., using python -m venv .venv).

Activate the virtual environment (provide commands for both Unix-like systems and Windows).

Initialize a Git repository in this directory."

Stop: Await human execution of these commands.

Prompt 1.2: "AI, generate a standard Python .gitignore file content, including common patterns for virtual environments, IDE files, and Python cache files."

Stop: Await human creation of .gitignore with this content. Phase 1, Step 1 complete. Start next prompt for Phase 1, Step 2.

Develop Core Data Structures:

Action: Design Python classes/data structures to internally represent:

A Compound Action workflow.

An individual action step (attributes: action_name, description (str, new), output_key, input_args dictionary, progress_updates, delay_config, user_provided_json_output (str), parsed_json_output (any)).

An individual script step (attributes: description (str, new), code, output_key, input_args dictionary, user_provided_json_output (str), parsed_json_output (any)).

The data object context (to track input variables and output_keys which will point to parsed_json_output).

Reference: Sections 2.1, 2.3, 11.1 of the Source of Truth Document[cite: 18, 19, 23, 93].

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 2.1: "AI, create a Python file named core_structures.py. Based on Sections 2.1, 2.3, and 11.1 (for action and script attributes) of the Source of Truth Document, define the following Python classes using dataclasses or Pydantic:

ActionStep: Attributes for action_name (str), description (str, optional), output_key (str), input_args (dict, optional), progress_updates (dict, optional, with on_pending and on_complete keys), delay_config (dict, optional, with keys like milliseconds, seconds), user_provided_json_output (str, optional), parsed_json_output (any, optional, to store the parsed version of user_provided_json_output).

ScriptStep: Attributes for description (str, optional), code (str), output_key (str), input_args (dict, optional), user_provided_json_output (str, optional), parsed_json_output (any, optional).

Workflow: Attribute steps (a list that can contain ActionStep or ScriptStep instances or other future step types).

DataContext: Placeholder class for now (to be detailed in Phase 1, Step 4).
Ensure type hints are used. For optional fields, use Optional and provide default values (e.g., None or empty dicts/strings)."

Stop: Await human review of core_structures.py.

Next Prompt (if changes needed): "AI, modify the ActionStep class in core_structures.py to ensure input_args defaults to an empty dictionary if not provided." (or similar refinement).

Next Prompt (if OK): "Proceed to Phase 1, Step 3: Implement Basic YAML Generation Module."

Implement Basic YAML Generation Module:

Action: Create a Python module responsible for taking the internal workflow representation (a sequence of action and script steps) and generating a syntactically correct YAML string.

Requirement: Must correctly implement the steps: list[cite: 18, 19].

Requirement: Handle basic action and script structures as defined in Section 11.1 of the Source of Truth Document[cite: 93].

Requirement: Ensure proper indentation and YAML formatting[cite: 77].

Tooling: Select a Python YAML library (e.g., PyYAML or ruamel.yaml for more control over formatting).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 3.1: "AI, create a Python file named yaml_generator.py. This module will use the PyYAML library (add it to a requirements.txt file). Implement a function workflow_to_yaml_dict(workflow: Workflow) -> dict that converts a Workflow instance (from core_structures.py) into a Python dictionary suitable for PyYAML serialization. This dictionary should represent the steps list. For each ActionStep, include action_name, output_key, and input_args (if not empty). For each ScriptStep, include code, output_key, and input_args (if not empty). Ensure progress_updates and delay_config are included for ActionStep if present and not empty. Filter out optional fields that are None or empty from the final dictionary representation of each step to keep YAML clean. Do not include description, user_provided_json_output, or parsed_json_output in the generated YAML dictionary."

Stop: Await human review of the workflow_to_yaml_dict function.

Prompt 3.2: "AI, in yaml_generator.py, add a function generate_yaml_string(workflow: Workflow) -> str that uses workflow_to_yaml_dict and PyYAML (yaml.dump) to produce a YAML string. Ensure proper indentation (2 spaces) and that block scalars are used for multi-line APIthon code if appropriate. Provide an example usage creating a simple Workflow with one ActionStep and one ScriptStep and printing its YAML string."

Stop: Await human review and testing of the YAML output. Phase 1, Step 3 complete. Start next prompt for Phase 1, Step 4.

Implement data Object Context Management:

Action: Develop logic to simulate the data object.

Functionality:

Allow registration of CA input variables (Section 2.2 [cite: 22]).

Track output_keys from generated steps. The value associated with an output_key will be the parsed_json_output of that step. (Section 2.3 [cite: 23]).

Handle the _ for unused output_keys[cite: 23].

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 4.1: "AI, update the DataContext class in core_structures.py. Implement the following:

An __init__ method that can optionally accept a dictionary of initial CA input variables (these are distinct from step outputs). Store these internally.

A method add_step_output(self, output_key: str, parsed_json_value: any): If output_key is not '_', store the parsed_json_value associated with output_key. This parsed_json_value comes from the parsed_json_output attribute of an ActionStep or ScriptStep.

A method get_data_value(self, path_string: str) -> any: This method should parse path_string (e.g., 'input_var' or 'step_output_key.nested_key'). It should first check initial CA inputs, then step outputs (which are the parsed JSONs). Implement basic dot notation access for nested dictionaries/lists within these stored JSONs. Raise a custom DataPathNotFound exception if the path is invalid.

A method is_path_available(self, path_string: str) -> bool.
Include basic docstrings for these methods."

Stop: Await human review of the DataContext class.

Prompt 4.2 (Optional): "AI, write a few PyTest unit tests for the DataContext class, covering initialization with inputs, adding step outputs (parsed JSON objects), and retrieving values (valid paths, nested paths, invalid paths from these stored JSONs)."

Stop: Await human review of tests. Phase 1, Step 4 complete. Start next prompt for Phase 1, Step 5.

Develop Initial Validation Service (Basic):

Action: Create a validation module that checks the generated YAML or internal representation for:

Presence of mandatory keys for action (action_name, output_key) and script (code, output_key)[cite: 93].

Basic output_key uniqueness (Section 8.2 [cite: 79]).

Reference: Section 8.1, 11.1 of the Source of Truth Document[cite: 77, 93].

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 5.1: "AI, create a Python file named validator.py. Implement a function validate_step(step, existing_output_keys: set) -> list[str] where step is an ActionStep or ScriptStep instance.

If ActionStep, check for action_name and output_key.

If ScriptStep, check for code and output_key.

If output_key is not '_', check if it's in existing_output_keys. If so, add an error.

Return a list of error message strings. Add the output_key to existing_output_keys if it's valid and not '_'."

Stop: Await human review of validate_step.

Prompt 5.2: "AI, in validator.py, implement validate_workflow(workflow: Workflow, initial_data_context: DataContext) -> list[str]. This function should iterate through workflow.steps:

Maintain a set of seen_output_keys (initialized from initial_data_context's top-level keys if desired, or start empty).

For each step, call validate_step. Accumulate errors.

(Future enhancement placeholder: data reference validation using initial_data_context.is_path_available for input_args).
Return a list of all error messages."

Stop: Await human review. Phase 1, Step 5 complete. Start next prompt for Phase 1, Step 6.

Create Basic Input Mechanism & Output:

Decision: For this phase, a Command Line Interface (CLI) will be used to define a sequence of actions.

Action (CLI): Implement CLI commands to:

Add an action step (prompt for name, description, output key, simple key-value for input args, and the JSON output string for this action).

Add a script step (prompt for description, output key, simple key-value for input args, code, and the JSON output string for this script).

Generate and print YAML.

Run validation.

Action: Ensure the application can output the generated YAML to the console or a file.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance (CLI Implementation):

Prompt 6.1 (CLI chosen): "AI, create main_cli.py. Using the click library for Python:

Implement a main command group.

Implement a command add_action that prompts the user for action_name, description, output_key. For input_args, prompt for key-value pairs iteratively. Then, prompt for a multi-line JSON string for user_provided_json_output. Create an ActionStep instance, parse the user_provided_json_output (e.g., using json.loads) and store it in parsed_json_output. Store these steps in a global list (for simplicity in Phase 1).

Implement add_script that prompts for description, output_key, code (as multi-line input), input_args (iterative key-value), and a multi-line JSON string for user_provided_json_output. Create a ScriptStep instance, parse and store its JSON output.

Implement show_yaml that uses yaml_generator.generate_yaml_string on the current workflow list and prints to console.

Implement validate that uses validator.validate_workflow (with an empty DataContext for now, to be populated with step outputs later) and prints errors or 'Workflow is valid'."

Stop: Await human review and testing of the basic CLI functionality. Phase 1, Step 6 complete. Phase 1 complete. Start next prompt for Phase 2.

Verification/Checkpoints for Phase 1:

Can the system generate valid YAML for a sequence of 2-3 action and script steps?

Are output_keys correctly registered in the internal data context representation, pointing to the parsed JSON outputs?

Does basic validation for mandatory keys and output_key uniqueness work?

Is the generated YAML compliant with basic Moveworks syntax for these simple steps? [cite: 77, 93]

Phase 2: UI/UX Development & Enhanced Data Mapping
Objective: Develop the primary user interface (desktop or web based on architectural decision) for guided, list-based workflow creation. Implement robust JSON output handling for each step and the ability to map variables from these outputs to subsequent step inputs.

Knowledge Base Focus (Source of Truth Document):

Section 2.2 (Input Variables) [cite: 22]

Section 2.3 (The data Object) [cite: 23]

Section 2.4 (requestor, mw Objects - basic awareness) [cite: 24]

Section 3 (Parsing and Referencing Retrieved JSON Data) [cite: 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]

UI/UX design principles for data-centric workflow tools.

Next Steps & Action Items:

Finalize UI Architecture Choice:

Decision: Based on prior discussions (preference against TypeScript, ease of creation):

Option A: Python Desktop Application: (e.g., PySide6).

Option B: Python SSR Web App + Minimal JS: (e.g., Flask/Django + Jinja2 + HTMX/Alpine.js).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance (Decision Support):

Prompt 2.1.1: "AI, given the preference for Python-centric solutions and a data-input focused UI (not a visual canvas), elaborate on the pros and cons of Option A (PySide6 Desktop App) vs. Option B (Python SSR Web App with Flask/Jinja2 and minimal JS like HTMX) for this project. Consider UI complexity for managing a list of steps, dynamic forms for action configuration, and displaying/interacting with JSON structures."

Stop: Await human decision on UI architecture (e.g., "Proceed with Option A: PySide6").

Action: Set up the chosen UI framework and project structure.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance (Setup for chosen option):

Prompt 2.1.2 (if Option A - PySide6 chosen): "AI, outline the initial PySide6 project structure. Create a basic main_gui.py with a QMainWindow, a menu bar, and placeholders for: a main step list area, a detailed configuration panel for the selected step, and a YAML preview panel. Add PySide6 to requirements.txt."

Prompt 2.1.2 (if Option B - Flask/Jinja2 chosen): "AI, set up a basic Flask application structure: app.py, a templates folder with a base.html and index.html. index.html should have placeholders for these main areas. Add Flask and Jinja2 to requirements.txt."

Stop: Await human review of the initial UI project setup.

Design & Implement Core UI Layout:

Action: Create the main application window/page with distinct areas for:

A step list area (to display the sequence of defined actions).

A step configuration panel (to edit selected step's name, description, input args, and its JSON output).

A JSON variable selection panel (to display parsed JSON output of a selected previous step and allow path selection).

A YAML preview panel.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance (UI Layout - specific to chosen architecture):

Prompt 2.2.1 (PySide6): "AI, in main_gui.py, use PySide6 layout managers to arrange:

A QListWidget (for the step list).

A QStackedWidget or dynamic panel area for step configuration.

A QTreeWidget (for JSON variable selection from a step's output).

A QTextEdit (for YAML preview).
Ensure these areas are logically arranged and resizable."

Prompt 2.2.1 (Flask/Jinja2): "AI, update templates/index.html using HTML and basic CSS to create the four main layout areas. Use div elements with appropriate IDs. These can be simple placeholders initially."

Stop: Await human review of the visual layout.

Implement Workflow Step List Management:

Action: The step list area should allow users to add new action or script steps.

Action: Allow users to select, reorder, and remove steps from this list.

Action: Selecting a step in the list populates the step configuration panel.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance (Step List UI - specific to chosen architecture):

Prompt 2.3.1 (PySide6): "AI, using the QListWidget for the step list:

Add 'Add Action' and 'Add Script' buttons. Clicking these appends a new ActionStep or ScriptStep (from core_structures.py with default values) to an internal workflow list and adds a display item (e.g., 'Step X: New Action') to the QListWidget.

Implement 'Remove Selected' and 'Move Up'/'Move Down' buttons.

When an item in QListWidget is selected, trigger population of the step configuration panel with the corresponding step object's data."

Prompt 2.3.1 (Flask/Jinja2 + HTMX): "AI, in app.py and templates/index.html:

The step list area displays steps from a server-side list.

'Add Action'/'Add Script' buttons POST to Flask routes, adding new step objects to the server-side list and re-rendering the step list (and potentially other parts of the page via HTMX).

Implement remove/reorder functionality via Flask routes."

Stop: Await human review of basic step list management.

Develop Step Configuration Panel:

Action: For a selected step, this panel must allow editing:

Action/Script Name.

Description.

output_key.

input_args (key-value, where values can be manually typed or mapped from previous step outputs).

For ScriptStep: code.

A text area to paste/edit the step's JSON output string. A "Parse & Save JSON Output" button.

Requirement: Changes update the internal workflow representation and trigger YAML preview updates. Parsing the JSON output updates the parsed_json_output of the step object.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance (Config Panel - specific to architecture):

Prompt 2.4.1 (PySide6): "AI, create/update the StepConfigurationPanel. When a step is selected:

Display QLineEdits for action_name (if ActionStep), description, output_key.

Display QTextEdit for code (if ScriptStep).

Implement a QTableWidget or custom widget for input_args (key-value pairs).

Add a large QTextEdit for user_provided_json_output. Add a button 'Parse & Save JSON Output'. On click, parse the text area content; if valid JSON, store it in the step object's user_provided_json_output (string) and parsed_json_output (parsed object). If invalid, show an error.

Changes should update the step object. Trigger YAML preview update."

Prompt 2.4.1 (Flask/Jinja2): "AI, create Flask routes and template partials for the step configuration panel:

When a step is selected (e.g., via a link that loads its details into this panel area), display a form with fields for name, description, output_key, code (if script), input_args (dynamic key-value), and a textarea for user_provided_json_output.

A 'Parse & Save JSON Output' button (or form submission) sends the JSON string to a Flask route, which parses it and updates the step object on the server.

Submitting the main form updates the step object. Re-render relevant page parts."

Stop: Await human review of step configuration, especially JSON output input and parsing.

Implement JSON Output Variable Selection & Input Argument Mapping:

Action: When a step (say, Step M) is selected in the step list, and its parsed_json_output is available:

The "JSON Variable Selection Panel" displays the structure of Step M's parsed_json_output (e.g., in a tree view).

Users can click on paths/fields in this tree to "select" a data path (e.g., step_M_output_key.some.field or step_M_output_key.array[i].field).

Action: When configuring input_args for a different step (say, Step N, where N > M):

The user should be able to use the "selected variable" from Step M (or any other preceding step's output) to populate the value of an input argument for Step N.

This involves constructing the correct data.step_M_output_key.path.to.selected.field string.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance (Variable Selection & Mapping - specific to architecture):

Prompt 2.5.1 (PySide6): "AI, for the JSON Variable Selection Panel (QTreeWidget):

When a step in the main list is selected AND its parsed_json_output is not None, populate this QTreeWidget with the structure of that parsed_json_output.

Allow users to select items in this tree. When selected, store the full data path (e.g., data.selected_step_output_key.actual.path.from.json) in a temporary variable or clipboard-like fashion.

In the input_args editor of the StepConfigurationPanel, provide a button like 'Use Selected JSON Variable' next to each input argument's value field. Clicking it pastes the stored path."

Prompt 2.5.1 (Flask/Jinja2 + JS): "AI, for the JSON Variable Selection Panel:

When a step is selected (and its JSON output parsed on the server), a Flask route provides its JSON structure. Client-side JavaScript can render this into a tree view (e.g., using a lightweight JS library or simple nested UL/LI).

JS handles clicks on tree items to capture the path relative to that step's output.

When editing input_args for another step, JS allows pasting this captured path (prefixed with data.original_step_output_key.) into the input argument value fields."

Stop: Await human review of the variable selection and mapping mechanism. This is a core change.

Integrate Real-time YAML Preview:

Action: Ensure the YAML preview panel updates automatically (or via a button) whenever the workflow or step configurations change, especially input_args.

Action: Connect this to the YAML generation module from Phase 1.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance (YAML Preview - specific to chosen architecture):

Prompt 2.6.1 (PySide6): "AI, ensure the YAML preview panel updates whenever the internal workflow list or any step's input_args (or other YAML-relevant attributes) are modified. Use yaml_generator.generate_yaml_string."

Prompt 2.6.1 (Flask/Jinja2): "AI, ensure Flask routes re-render the YAML preview panel area when workflow data changes on the server. The template calls yaml_generator.generate_yaml_string."

Stop: Await human review of YAML preview updating.

Implement Workflow Save/Load (Local):

Action: Save/Load should now include the description and user_provided_json_output for each step.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance (Save/Load - specific to chosen architecture):

Prompt 2.7.1 (PySide6): "AI, update 'Save/Load Workflow' functionality. The JSON file should now serialize/deserialize the full ActionStep/ScriptStep objects including description and user_provided_json_output. On load, re-parse user_provided_json_output into parsed_json_output for each step."

Prompt 2.7.1 (Flask/Jinja2): "AI, update 'Download/Upload Workflow File'. Server-side logic should handle serialization/deserialization of the complete step objects, including description and user_provided_json_output. On upload, re-parse JSON outputs."

Stop: Await human testing of save/load. Phase 2 complete. Start next prompt for Phase 3.

Verification/Checkpoints for Phase 2:

Can users define a sequence of actions, providing name, description, and JSON output for each?

Is the JSON output parsed and its structure available for variable selection?

Can users map variables from one action's JSON output to another action's input_args?

Does the YAML preview reflect these mappings correctly?

Can workflows with this new structure be saved and loaded?

Phase 3: Control Flow & Advanced Data Transformation
Objective: Implement full support for Moveworks control flow constructs (switch, for, parallel) using the new data-centric approach where conditions and loop sources are derived from previously defined action JSON outputs. Integrate assistance for DSL and APIthon.

Knowledge Base Focus (Source of Truth Document):

Section 4.1 (DSL) & Table 1 [cite: 32, 33, 34]

Section 4.2 (APIthon - full details) [cite: 35, 36, 37, 38]

Section 5 (Workflow Logic - all subsections) [cite: 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]

Section 8.1 (DSL quoting and APIthon multi-line) [cite: 77]

Section 11.1 (YAML Syntax for switch, for, parallel, return) [cite: 93]

Section 11.3 (APIthon Constraints) [cite: 97]

Next Steps & Action Items:

Implement switch Expression UI & Logic:

Action: Add a "switch" step type to the step list.

Action: UI for defining cases. Each case has a condition (a string, e.g., data.action1_output.status == 'completed', formed by selecting variables from previous steps' JSON outputs and applying operators) and nested steps.

Action: Update YAML generation and validation.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 3.1.1: (Data structures for SwitchStep, SwitchCase, DefaultCase as before).

Stop: Review data structures.

Prompt 3.1.2 (UI): "AI, update UI to add 'Switch Step'. The Configuration Panel for a Switch Step should allow:

Adding/removing cases. For each case: an input field for the condition string. This field should allow mapping variables from previous steps' JSON outputs (like input_args do).

Defining nested steps for each case and the optional default case (this might re-use the main step definition UI components in a nested context, including defining their own JSON outputs if they are actions/scripts)."

Stop: Review UI for switch configuration, especially condition building.

Prompt 3.1.3 & 3.1.4: (YAML generation and validation for switch as before).

Stop: Review.

Implement for Loop Expression UI & Logic:

Action: Add a "for loop" step type.

Action: UI for configuring each, index, in (where in is a path selected from a previous step's JSON output, e.g., data.action1_output.users_array), and output_key.

Action: Allow defining nested steps within the loop. For these nested steps, input_args mapping must be able to reference fields of the each item (e.g., if each is currentUser, then currentUser.email). Each nested action/script also defines its own JSON output.

Action: Update YAML generation and validation.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 3.2.1: (Data structure for ForLoopStep as before).

Stop: Review.

Prompt 3.2.2 (UI): "AI, update UI for 'For Loop Step'. Configuration Panel:

Inputs for each, index, output_key.

Input for in_source: This should allow selecting an array path from a previous step's JSON output using the JSON Variable Selection Panel.

A way to define nested steps. When configuring these nested steps, the data context for variable selection must include the each item's structure (derived from the schema of the selected in_source array elements)."

Stop: Review UI for for configuration, especially in_source selection and context for nested steps.

Prompt 3.2.3 & 3.2.4: (YAML generation and validation for for as before).

Stop: Review.

Implement parallel Expression UI & Logic: (Similar updates, focusing on defining branches whose steps also have defined JSON outputs and can map inputs from steps outside and before the parallel block).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompts 3.3.1 - 3.3.4: (Update data structures, UI, YAML gen, validation for ParallelStep. Each branch will contain steps that are defined with their own JSON outputs and can map inputs from steps defined before the parallel block).

Stop: Review at each sub-step.

Implement return Expression UI & Logic: (The output_mapper will map values from previous steps' JSON outputs).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompts 3.4.1 - 3.4.4: (Update data structures, UI, YAML gen, validation for ReturnStep. The output_mapper values will be constructed by selecting paths from previous steps' JSON outputs).

Stop: Review at each sub-step.

Develop DSL Assistance Features: (DSL expressions will use variables selected from previous steps' JSON outputs).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 3.5.1 (UI): "AI, for text input fields that accept DSL (e.g., values in input_args, output_mapper, condition):

Enhance the 'Use Selected JSON Variable' feature to allow easy insertion of selected data paths into DSL templates provided by a dropdown (e.g., for $CONCAT)."

Stop: Review.

Prompt 3.5.2: (DSL quoting and generation as before).

Stop: Review.

Enhance APIthon Script Editor: (APIthon input_args will be mapped from previous steps' JSON outputs).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompts 3.6.1 & 3.6.2: (As before, focusing on multi-line and constraints display. The mapping of input_args for scripts will use the established variable selection mechanism).

Stop: Review. Phase 3 complete.

Verification/Checkpoints for Phase 3:

Can control flow steps (switch, for, parallel) be configured using data paths selected from previous actions' JSON outputs?

For for loops, can nested steps correctly reference fields of the iteration item?

Are DSL and APIthon input_args correctly mapped using selected variables?

Is the generated YAML for these constructs valid?

Phase 4: Built-in Actions & Comprehensive Error Handling
Objective: Integrate Moveworks Built-in Actions (many of which have defined JSON output schemas that the app can pre-populate) and enable users to configure robust error handling using the established data mapping paradigm.

Knowledge Base Focus (Source of Truth Document):

Section 6 (Error Handling - all subsections) & 11.2 (error_data) [cite: 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 95]

Section 7 (Built-in Actions - all subsections) & Table 2 [cite: 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]

Section 2.4 (mw object) [cite: 24]

Section 11.1 (YAML Syntax for raise, try_catch) [cite: 93]

Next Steps & Action Items:

Develop Built-in Action (mw.) Catalog & Configuration:

Action: When a mw. action is selected:

Pre-fill its action_name.

Dynamically generate the configuration form for its specific input_args.

New: If the mw. action has a known, typical JSON output structure (from Table 2 or other documentation), pre-populate the "JSON output string" text area with an example of this structure. The user can then confirm or modify it.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 4.1.1: "AI, update mw_actions_catalog.py. For each mw. action, add an optional field typical_json_output_example (string) that contains a pretty-printed JSON string representing its common output structure (e.g., for mw.get_user_by_email, include the output.user structure)."

Stop: Review catalog data.

Prompt 4.1.2 (UI): "AI, when a mw. action is selected from the catalog to be added as a new step:

Pre-fill its action_name.

The Properties Panel should dynamically display its input_args form.

If typical_json_output_example exists in the catalog for this action, pre-populate the user_provided_json_output text area with it. The user can then edit if needed before parsing."

Stop: Review UI for mw. action pre-population.

Implement User Object Dependency Logic: (As before, but mapping will use variable selection from previous steps' JSON outputs).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance (UI/Logic):

Prompt 4.2.1: (Conceptual logic as before. The key is that the DataContext check will be against parsed JSON outputs of previous steps).

Stop: Review.

Implement try_catch Block UI & Logic:

Action: try and catch blocks will contain sequences of steps, each defined with their name, description, and JSON output.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompts 4.3.1 - 4.3.4: (Data structures, UI, YAML gen, validation as before. Nested steps within try/catch are defined like any other steps, including their JSON outputs).

Stop: Review at each sub-step.

Implement raise Expression UI & Logic: (A RaiseStep doesn't typically have a JSON output of its own in the same way an action does, as it halts execution. Its output_key is for error information).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 4.4.1: "AI, define RaiseStep in core_structures.py with output_key (str), message (str, optional), and description (str, optional). It does not need user_provided_json_output."

Stop: Review.

Prompts 4.4.2 - 4.4.4 (UI, YAML Gen, Validation): (As before, but no JSON output field for RaiseStep).

Stop: Review.

Expose error_data in catch Blocks: (Mapping from error_data will use the variable selection mechanism, now applied to the known structure of error_data).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance (UI/Logic):

Prompt 4.5.1: "AI, when configuring input_args for a step inside a `CatchBlock*:

The JSON Variable Selection Panel should offer to display the structure of error_data. This structure would be error_data.<output_key_of_a_try_block_step>.error (e.g., fields like message, code).

The user can then select paths from this error_data structure to map to inputs."

Stop: Review error_data mapping.

Offer Error Handling Pattern Templates: (As before, placeholders will be full step definitions requiring name, desc, JSON output if they are actions/scripts).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance (UI):

Prompt 4.6.1: (As before. Placeholders will be ActionStep or ScriptStep instances that the user then fully configures, including their JSON outputs if applicable).

Stop: Review. Phase 4 complete.

Verification/Checkpoints for Phase 4:

For mw. actions, is typical JSON output pre-filled for user confirmation/editing?

Can try_catch blocks be configured with nested steps that also have their JSON outputs defined?

Can error_data paths be selected and mapped to inputs within catch blocks?

Phase 5: Advanced Validation, Polish & Documentation
Objective: Implement the full suite of Moveworks validation checks based on the data-centric workflow, refine the user experience, and prepare comprehensive documentation.

Knowledge Base Focus (Source of Truth Document):

Section 8 (Ensuring YAML Validity - all subsections) & Table 3 [cite: 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]

Section 1.1, 1.2 (Purpose, Target Audience - for app documentation) [cite: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

All Appendix sections (11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4) for final checks and documentation [cite: 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]

Next Steps & Action Items:

Implement Comprehensive Validation Engine:

Action: Extend validation to ensure that all data. paths used in input_args, conditions, in_source etc., correctly reference fields available from the parsed_json_output of preceding steps stored in the DataContext.

Action: Validate the structure of user-provided JSON outputs against known schemas for mw. actions if strict validation is desired.

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 5.1.1: "AI, enhance validator.validate_workflow.

Iterate through steps. For each step, first add its output_key and parsed_json_output to a running DataContext instance.

Then, for the current step's input_args (and condition for switch, in_source for for), validate all data.some_key.path... references against this running DataContext using is_path_available. Report errors for invalid paths.
Refer to Section 8.2 and Table 3."

Stop: Review data reference validation logic.

Prompt 5.1.2 & 5.1.3: (Structural validation and UI error display as before).

Stop: Review.

UI/UX Polish: (Focus on ease of pasting JSON, selecting variables from potentially large JSONs, and managing the step list).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 5.2.1: "AI, review the UI. Suggest improvements for:

Displaying and navigating large parsed JSON structures in the Variable Selection Panel.

Ease of editing input_args and mapping variables.

Overall flow of defining a step (name, desc, JSON output, then its inputs)."

Stop: Review and select improvements.

Prompt 5.2.2 (Iterative): (Implement selected improvements).

Stop: Iterate.

Develop In-App Help & Documentation: (As before).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompts 5.3.1 & 5.3.2: (As before).

Stop: Review.

Final Testing & Quality Assurance: (Test cases will involve providing specific JSON outputs for each step).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 5.4.1: "AI, based on Section 9 examples: For each step in those examples, define the JSON output that step would produce. Then, create test cases specifying:

Action Name, Description, and its JSON output to be entered by the user for each step.

How input_args for subsequent steps are mapped from these JSON outputs.

Expected final YAML."

Stop: Review test cases. Human performs testing.

(Stretch Goal) Implement Basic AI-Powered Assistance: (e.g., If user pastes JSON output for an action, AI could try to infer the action_name or suggest common mw. actions that produce similar JSON).

🤖 AI Execution Guidance:

Prompt 5.5.1 (Conceptual): "AI, for a feature 'Suggest Action Name from JSON Output':

When a user pastes JSON into user_provided_json_output for a new generic 'Action Step'.

Outline how the AI could analyze the JSON structure (key names, data types) and compare it against the typical_json_output_example in mw_actions_catalog.py to suggest possible mw. action names or a generic 'HTTP Action'."

Stop: Review conceptual design.

Verification/Checkpoints for Phase 5:

Does the validation engine correctly verify data paths against user-provided JSON outputs of previous steps?

Is the UI for defining actions, their JSON outputs, and mapping variables intuitive?

Is the application stable and performant with potentially large JSON objects per step?

This interactive project plan provides a structured path to developing the "AI-Powered Moveworks Compound Action Assistant." Each phase builds upon the last, ensuring that the core logic is sound before adding more complex features and UI elements. Constant reference to the "Generating Verified Moveworks Compound Action YAML for AI Application Development.docx" will be paramount for accuracy.
