# Action Name Compliance Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive implementation of action_name field compliance for the Moveworks YAML Assistant. The implementation enforces strict compliance requirements for action_name fields in ActionStep instances while providing excellent user experience through real-time validation, catalog integration, and helpful suggestions.

## Core Implementation Requirements ✅

### 1. Field Naming Standardization
- **✅ Exact Field Name**: All ActionStep instances use the exact field name "action_name" in both UI forms and generated YAML
- **✅ No Variants**: Prevents use of "actionName", "action", or other naming variants
- **✅ YAML Consistency**: Generated YAML consistently uses "action_name:" field
- **✅ UI Standardization**: All UI forms use standardized "Action Name" labels

### 2. Mandatory Field Enforcement
- **✅ ActionStep Requirement**: action_name is always required and must be non-empty for ActionStep instances
- **✅ YAML Generation Blocking**: Blocks YAML generation if action_name is missing or empty
- **✅ Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback when action_name is missing or invalid
- **✅ Context-aware Logic**: Only enforces requirement for ActionStep (not ScriptStep or other types)

### 3. UI Integration
- **✅ Enhanced Input Fields**: Added action_name fields with mandatory field indicators (*)
- **✅ Visual Validation**: Real-time validation with color-coded borders and indicators
- **✅ PySide6 Integration**: Follows established UI patterns (8px margins, #f8f8f8 backgrounds)
- **✅ Contextual Tooltips**: Helpful tooltips explaining action_name usage and requirements

### 4. Data Type Validation
- **✅ String Enforcement**: Validates that action_name values are non-empty strings
- **✅ Naming Conventions**: Enforces alphanumeric characters, dots, and underscores only
- **✅ Format Validation**: Validates proper mw. prefix format for Moveworks actions
- **✅ Length Requirements**: Minimum 2 characters required

## Technical Specifications ✅

## Validation Requirements ✅

### Mandatory Field Validation
- **✅ Empty Field Detection**: Prevents empty or whitespace-only action_name values
- **✅ Null Value Handling**: Properly handles None values in action_name fields
- **✅ Step Type Specificity**: Only enforces requirement for ActionStep instances
- **✅ Clear Error Messages**: Specific error messages indicating missing action_name

### Naming Convention Validation
- **✅ Character Validation**: Only allows letters, numbers, dots, and underscores
- **✅ Length Validation**: Minimum 2 characters required
- **✅ MW Prefix Validation**: Validates proper "mw." prefix format for Moveworks actions
- **✅ Special Character Blocking**: Prevents spaces, hyphens, and other invalid characters

### Catalog Integration
- **✅ Known Action Recognition**: Identifies actions from MW_ACTIONS_CATALOG
- **✅ Unknown Action Warnings**: Warns about actions not in the catalog
- **✅ Suggestion System**: Provides suggestions for similar or corrected action names
- **✅ Category Organization**: Organizes actions by category for better discovery

## Integration Points ✅

### Existing Systems
- **✅ Compliance Validator Architecture**: Seamlessly integrates with existing validation system
- **✅ MW_ACTIONS_CATALOG**: Full integration with Moveworks Actions Catalog
- **✅ Real-time Validation Manager**: Enhanced with action_name specific validation
- **✅ YAML Generation Pipeline**: Integrated validation gates in generation process

### UI Components
- **✅ ActionStep Configuration Dialog**: Enhanced with mandatory field indicators
- **✅ YAML Preview Panel**: Shows validation errors when generation is blocked
- **✅ Export Functionality**: Prevents export of non-compliant workflows
- **✅ Error Display System**: Integrated with existing error reporting framework

## Testing and Validation ✅

### Comprehensive Test Suite
**File**: `test_action_name_compliance.py`
- Mandatory field enforcement testing for ActionStep instances
- Naming convention validation with valid/invalid test cases
- MW prefix format validation testing
- Catalog integration testing with known/unknown actions
- YAML generation blocking validation
- Field name standardization verification
- Data type validation testing
- Suggestion system functionality testing

### Demonstration Scripts
**File**: `demo_action_name_compliance.py`
- Compliant workflow examples with proper action_name usage
- Non-compliant workflow demonstrations showing validation errors
- Individual validation showcases with error messages and suggestions
- Catalog integration examples with action discovery

## Key Features Demonstrated ✅

### 1. Mandatory Field Enforcement
```python
# ActionStep always requires action_name
action_step = ActionStep(
    action_name="mw.get_user_by_email",  # ✅ Required
    output_key="user_info",
    description="Get user information"
)
```

### 2. Naming Convention Validation
```python
# Valid: mw.get_user_by_email, custom_action, my.action.name
# Invalid: "action name", "action-name", "action@name", "mw."
```

### 3. Catalog Integration
```python
# Known Moveworks actions are recognized and validated
# Unknown actions generate warnings with suggestions
# Custom actions are allowed with proper naming
```

### 4. YAML Generation Blocking
```python
# Non-compliant workflows cannot generate YAML
try:
    yaml_output = generate_yaml_string(workflow)
except ValueError as e:
    # Clear error message with remediation steps
```

## User Experience Features ✅

### Visual Feedback System
- **✅ Green Checkmark**: Valid known Moveworks action
- **✅ Orange Question Mark**: Valid format but not in catalog
- **✅ Red X**: Invalid action_name with error details
