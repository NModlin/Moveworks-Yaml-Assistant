### **DSL Condition Support**

1. **Supported Condition Types**
   - Simple equality comparisons: `data.user.role == 'admin'`
   - Inequality comparisons: `data.temperature > 25`
   - Boolean logic: `data.active == true and data.verified == true`
   - String operations: `meta_info.user.email.endswith('@company.com')`
   - Complex expressions: `data.age >= 18 and data.department == 'IT'`

2. **Data Reference Patterns**
   - `data.*` - Access to workflow input and step output data
   - `meta_info.*` - Access to system and user metadata
   - Proper DSL string quoting in generated YAML
   - Validation of data path syntax

3. **Validation Features**
   - Real-time condition syntax validation
   - Visual feedback (âœ“/âœ—) for condition validity
   - Educational error messages with remediation suggestions
   - Integration with existing DSL validator system

### **YAML Generation Enhancement**

1. **Switch Expression Structure**
   ```yaml
   - switch:
       cases:
       - condition: "data.user.role == 'admin'"
         steps:
         - action:
             action_name: mw.grant_admin_access
             output_key: admin_result
       - condition: "data.user.role == 'member'"
         steps:
         - action:
             action_name: mw.grant_member_access
             output_key: member_result
       default:
         steps:
         - action:
             action_name: mw.log_unknown_role
             output_key: log_result
   ```

2. **Proper Field Ordering**
   - Cases listed in definition order
   - Default case at the end of switch structure
   - Consistent indentation and formatting
   - DSL expressions properly quoted as strings

3. **Nested Expression Support**
   - Switch expressions can contain other switch expressions
   - Action and script steps properly nested within cases
   - Maintains proper YAML structure hierarchy
   - Supports complex workflow patterns
